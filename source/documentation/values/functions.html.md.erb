[Functions][] can be values too! You can't directly write a function as a value,
but you can pass a function's name to the [`get-function()` function][] to get
it as a value. Once you have a function value, you can pass it to the [`call()`
function][] to call it. This is useful for writing *higher-order functions* that
call other functions.

[`get-function` function]: ../functions/meta#get-function
[`call()` function]: ../functions/meta#call
